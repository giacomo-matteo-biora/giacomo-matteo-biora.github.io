👋🏼 Hello! I'm a 13-year-old boy passionate about computer science. 

💻 I really like everything about it, from programming to hardware, AI, and more. My computer passion started when I was 11 years old when I read my first book on Python.

🌍 From there, a whole new world opened up, and I started studying by reading books, following YouTube courses, attending some university classes, and most recently, attending conferences. 

👨‍🎓 I'm finishing up my middle school studies, and soon I'll be enrolling in high school. Of course, I've chosen to attend a technical institute specializing in computer science. This means I'll have five years of studying the subjects I love.

📚 I read a lot, not just computer science books but also biographies of famous people, novels, and essays.

🤓 I'm very passionate about what interests me. When I dive into new topics, I can't stop thinking about them for months until a new subject comes along. I jump from AI to cybersecurity, from finance to cryptocurrencies...

🔬 Fortunately, my father owns 2 Prusa printers and a Bambulab, so I'm also skilled in 3D printing and firmware.
